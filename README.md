natidja is an analyses laboratory website, where the client can find all his analyses history from multiple medical laboratory in the same platform.

# How it works

When ever a client went to a laboratory the laboratory create a new analyse with the client data, 
and a ticket with a username and password will be generated to the client, 
note that if this is not the first analyses of that client in the platform the username and password will be the same, 
and the analyses will automaticly set to in hold status,
when the reasult are really the laboratory upload the pdf of the result to that spesific analyse.<br>
For the client once he got his acces information, he can connect to the platform and check all his analyses and the results will be a pdf form
